# Whatbot-Order-Scraper
A simple to use script that will scrape all successful orders from your whatbot logs. Simply run the script and import as many log files as you want and when you want to compile all the checkouts type 'done' and it will give you the total checkouts.

1. Install python3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Make sure you add python3 to path when installing.
3. Unzip your zip file.
4. Open your command line console.
5. type 'cd' (no '') and then hit space and paste the location of your folder with the program in it.
6. You should see something like "C:\User\yourcomputernamehere\folderpath"
7. To run the program type python index.py
8. The program should start and then it should ask you to import a file or type done.
9. To import simply drag and drop your whatbot log file into the cmd and hit enter. You might have to delete the '&' sign and the quotes surrounding the path (these '')
10. Continue adding your files if you have multiples, if you are done simply type 'done'
11. The program should stop and output the total number of checkouts.
